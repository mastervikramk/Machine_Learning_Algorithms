# ðŸ¤– Machine Learning â€“ From Scratch

![Thumbnail for the repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mrnoobcoder/Machine_learning/main/Machine_Learning.jpg)

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This project is designed to help you deeply understand how popular machine learning algorithms work â€” by implementing them from scratch, **without using built-in functions** from libraries like scikit-learn.

---

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repo contains custom Python implementations for various **classifiers** and **regressors**, developed purely using base Python and NumPy.

These implementations are designed for **educational purposes** and can serve as a foundation for anyone looking to:

- Understand ML algorithms at a fundamental level.
- Build their own ML library.
- Prepare for machine learning interviews and exams.
- See what goes on "under the hood" of libraries like scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“š Algorithms Implemented

> ðŸ”§ All functions are handcrafted to simulate the behavior of real ML models.

### âœ… Classification

- Logistic Regression (from scratch)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Naive Bayes
- Perceptron

### ðŸ”¢ Regression

- Linear Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Polynomial Regression

### ðŸ§ª Other Concepts

- Gradient Descent
- Cross-validation
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, RMSE)
